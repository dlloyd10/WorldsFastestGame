# WorldsFastestGame
This is a guide on my game. "The Worlds Fastest Game"

This is a simple game I made that is super simple but I still like it because of how I made it and how weirdly easy it is. All you do in the game is click a button on the first real screen and you win/finish the game! Again, As I said its easy, and thats why weirdly fun and simple although it is boring. But the caption for the game screen saying "CLICK DA BUTTON!!!" is funny. Another fun thing is how when you finish you have the choice to play "Megalovania" from the popular game "Undertale". Anyways I have explained this game well enough for its simplicity. Now you know to play it. Thanks for reading! Hope you can play it!
